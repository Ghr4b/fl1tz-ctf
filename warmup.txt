**CTF Write-up: Directory Enumeration and Token Exploitation**

### Step 1: Directory Enumeration
Using tools like `dirb`, `ffuf`, or `gobuster`, we scanned the target website for hidden directories. This revealed two key directories:
```
/request  -> 403 Forbidden
/logs     -> 403 Forbidden
```

### Step 2: Fuzzing Hidden Paths
We then fuzzed these directories further and discovered:
```
/logs/admin_login
/request/authorized_keys
```
These endpoints hinted at sensitive information exposure.

### Step 3: Extracting the Token Format
By examining `/logs/admin_login`, we identified the format of the authentication token used by the application.

### Step 4: Retrieving the Token
We found an actual token inside `/request/authorized_keys`. This provided us with the necessary credentials.

### Step 5: Gaining Access
We set the request header to include our retrieved token, granting us access to the restricted area and successfully completing the challenge.
