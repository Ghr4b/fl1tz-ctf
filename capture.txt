**CTF Write-up: Exploiting spatie/browsershot for Local File Read**

### Step 1: Analyzing the Source Code
By inspecting the source code of the web application, we identified that it uses an outdated and vulnerable version of `spatie/browsershot`.

### Step 2: Finding the Vulnerability
Looking up this version on [Snyk](https://snyk.io/), we discovered that it is vulnerable to a Local File Inclusion (LFI) attack. Specifically, it allows accessing local files by using the `view-source:file:///` scheme.

### Step 3: Exploiting the Vulnerability
To read local files, we used the following URL:
```
view-source:file:///flag.txt
```
This exposed the contents of `flag.txt`, confirming the vulnerability.

### Step 4: Accessing the Screenshot
The application stores screenshots in a restricted directory, but we bypassed the restriction using directory traversal:
```
../forbidden/screenshot_name
```
This allowed us to retrieve the stored screenshot, potentially containing sensitive information.

### Conclusion
By leveraging the known vulnerability in `spatie/browsershot`, we successfully accessed restricted files and retrieved the flag.
